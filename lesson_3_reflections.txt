When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I am going to use a remote repository when my work need to be shared and colaborated with my team or others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I can think of one case like I pull remote repository that someone else made and I want to make a change to it. In this case,
once I downloaded it and edited, I do not want to simply get modification from original. I will do my own modification to it. Therefore
I won't use automatic pull from remote repository.
