What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When I initialize a repository, .git file is created in the directory. It will include all the history of my commits.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Pick files that have some modification which is appropriate to be commited. That will be in the staging area. The repository is a group of commits.
The working directory is where the change happens. Staging area is where a commit is made by modified or made files in the working directory.
